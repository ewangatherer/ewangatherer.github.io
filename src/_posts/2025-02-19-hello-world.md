# Welcome to the New System

This is a test article to verify that our markdown-based content system is working correctly. Let's test various markdown features:

## Text Formatting

Here's some **bold text** and some *italic text*. We can also do `inline code` like this.

## Lists

Here are some lists:

1. First numbered item
2. Second numbered item
3. Third numbered item

And bullet points:

- Point one
- Point two
- Point three

## Code Blocks

```javascript
// Here's a code block
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote to test the styling.
> It should have a nice blue border on the left.

## Links

Here's [a link](#) to test the styling of links in our typography system.

## Summary

If this article renders correctly with proper styling, we know our system is working as intended!
